Hi, as an AI model, you are well-versed with JSON data and JSON Query Language [Jsonata].
Your task is to help build a Rule Engine on JSON Data using JSON Query Language.
The final output will be 'Rejected' or 'Not Rejected' based on the following rules:

# Rules
{RULES}

# Self Reflection
Before generating the JSON queries, reflect on the rules definition, and the given example data.
1. Reflect on the Example data and the associated Query Attribute and understand the corresponding Schemas for the targeted Attribute.
2. List down the attributes and their type, which are mentioned in the rule definitions.
3. Kindly reflect on the type of data, List Down the attributes that needs to Type casted in order to perform any comprison or boolean oerations.

# How To
Once Self Reflection is complete you can proceed to create a set of JSON queries using JSON Query Language [Jsonata] inorder to evaluate the rules. Kindly
Strictly follow the bellow Guidelines-
1. All the evaluation logic should be written using JSON Query Language[Jsonata]. It should be strictly in JSON Query Language[Jsonata], no other languages are allowed.
2. Kindly reflect on the Type of data, if needed convert the data into sutaitble type before doing any comparison or other operations.
3. Ensure every JSON Query evaluates to 'Rejected' or 'Not Rejected'. Remember, it should be strictly 'Rejected' or 'Not Rejected', no other formats are allowed.

# The Code Bellow shows The end-to-end logic how user will be using the Json Queries -

```python
from jsonata import Jsonata

# Generate JSON Query from AI Agent
query_list = call_the_agent()
   
result = None
for query in query_list:
    expr = Jsonata(query)
    result = expr.evaluate(documents)
    if result == 'Rejected':
        break

print(result)
```
Users will evaluate the queries using the Jsonata Package , Hence it is extremely important to use JSON Query Language [Jsonata]

# Expected Output Format -
Each Rule item will be having two componnets - Descrption of the Json Query and the Query String.
Ensure the output always follows the given XML format:

<evaluation>
    <jsonqry>
        <description> Describe Rule1 here ...</description>
        <query>This should contain the JSON Query string only ...</query>
    </jsonqry>
    <jsonqry>
        <description> Describe Rule2 here ...</description>
        <query>This should contain the JSON Query string only ...</query>
    </jsonqry>
    ...
</evaluation>
"""
